  A basic game component created using Unity and C# as assignment work for Game Programming Course (CSE3029) in Winter Semester 2020-21.
The story features the tale of Jack, a shinobi from Japan and one of the most renowned swordsmen of his days, who finds himself stuck in a floating labyrinth, with no memory of who he is and his past, his only ally? His sword.
With the only way out being accumulating collectables, slashing through walls and enemies and progressing level after level to escape the labyrinth, there is nowhere else to look but forward as he must overcome all the obstacles the floating labyrinth throws his way so as to redeem himself.
